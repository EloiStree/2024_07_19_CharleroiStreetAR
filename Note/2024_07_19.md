AR might be one of the most frustrating technology…

if you don’t know how to get started with its development, here is a way you can get started with it (without a VR device):

Fundamentals:

1. 3D modelling (Blender / 3dsmax / Maya)
2. Spatial computing (basic understanding)
3. Native programming (for specific platforms listed below)

Next, if you want to get into Augmented reality, there are multiple ways you can get into it. For this, you have to decide what platform you want to use and the path you want to go forward with.


Platforms for mobile app development:

1. ARKit (for iOS): ARKit is natively used for augmented reality in iOS apps. For that, you have to be familiar with swiftUI which is used for creating iOS mobile applications.

2. ARCore (for Android): ARCore is used natively for Android. But to use ARCore you have to be familiar with Kotlin or Java which is used for creating Android applications.

3. Vuforia (using Unity): Vuforia is a cross-platform framework, that can be used with Unity. Vuforia can be used for getting started with very low code and you can level up to complexity using code.

4. ARFoundation (using Unity): ARfoundation is also a cross-platform which can be similarly used for integrating in iOS and Android.


Platforms for AR on Websites:

AR can be directly used in your websites using any framework (like React or Next) you are using, and these are the following ways:

1. WebXR: It can be used for creating immersive AR and VR experiences directly in web browsers

2. Three.js: A JavaScript library that makes it easy to create 3D content for the web.

3. AR.js: An efficient library for AR on the web, built on top of Three.js.


Other tools created by famous platforms:

Meta Spark Studio: It’s a tool created by Meta where you can create AR products and can also use them as filters on Meta products like Instagram.

Lens Studio: Lens Studio is also an AR tool to create no-code AR products, and you can launch your filters as well on Snapchat.


This was a very high-level direction of what you want to do in augmented reality, each one has a detailed roadmap for getting started.

P.S.: If you want to go through a detailed roadmap for each one of them, you can get started with documentation or you can also DM me.
